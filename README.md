# InterruptingJedisLocks
Jedis based lock which interrupts the locking thread if the leasing time is out

Two implementing classes
- InterruptingLock will create a new background thread to control the leasing time
- InterruptingLockExecutor will use a ExecutorService to retrieve a  thread to control the leasing time


Jedis is a Java library to use a Redis server with Java, at a low-level commands
